# Minecraft-Server-Status-Discord-Bot

This code creates a Discord bot that listens for the message "!serverstatus" and responds with the current status of the Minecraft server. To use this code, you will need to install the discord.js and minecraft-server-util packages, replace "YOUR_SERVER_IP" and "YOUR_SERVER_PORT" with the IP and port of your Minecraft server, and replace "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN" with your Discord bot token.
